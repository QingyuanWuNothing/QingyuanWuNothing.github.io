**My research interests live in the field of Reinforcement Learning.**



## About me
I am currently a first-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Liverpool, advised by [Prof. Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/). 

From April 2022 to September 2023, I experienced a period of memorable working time in the P2 team of [Parametrix.AI](https://chaocanshu.cn/index-en.html).

Prior to the industrial experience, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Xiaoyang Tan](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/).

Before that, I also received my B.S. in Mathmatics at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2019.
