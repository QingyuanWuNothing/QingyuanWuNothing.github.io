Who am I
------
Currently, I am first-year Ph.D. student of Department of Computer Science in University of Liverpool, advised by [Prof. Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/).
Before that, I earned my M.S. degree in Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, supervised by [Prof. Xiaoyang Tan](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/).

And from 2022 to 2023, I worked in [Parametrix Techonology](https://chaocanshu.cn/index-en.html) as a Gaming AI researcher focusing on applying reinforcement learning in FPS, TPS game. During this happy time, I, as the ACE of our squad, often led my colleagues to victories and left many highlights(many ACEs) in the FPS game called [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/).


Research Interest
------
My research interests mainly include reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning.
Currently, I am working on safe reinforcement learning on the system-level.
