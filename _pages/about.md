------
I am a first-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Liverpool, advised by [Prof. Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/). 
From April 2022 to September 2023, I experienced a period of memorable working time in the P2 team of [Parametrix.AI](https://chaocanshu.cn/index-en.html).
Prior to the UK, I earned my M.S. at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Xiaoyang Tan](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/).
Before that, I also received my B.E. at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2019.
