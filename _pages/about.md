Who am I
------
Currently, I am a first-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Liverpool, advised by [Prof. Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/main/). Before that, I earned my M.S. degree at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, supervised by [Prof. Xiaoyang Tan](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/).
From 2022 to 2023, I worked in [Parametrix Techonology](https://chaocanshu.cn/index-en.html) as a Gaming AI researcher focusing on applying reinforcement learning in challenging FPS and TPS games. During this happy time, I, as the ACE of our squad, often led my colleagues to victories and left many highlights(many ACEs) in the FPS game called [Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/).


Research Interests
------
My research interests mainly include reinforcement learning and unsupervised learning.

Currently, I am working on safe reinforcement learning on the system-level.
