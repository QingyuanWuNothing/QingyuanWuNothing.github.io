## About Me
**My research interests always live in the field of Reinforcement Learning.**

I am always available for internships or visiting scholarships related to **Reinforcement Learning**, please drop me an email if you are interested after reviewing my [CV](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nvmyzdtrzzny#21e99a).

## Brief Bio

* I am currently a first-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Liverpool, advised by [Prof. Chao Huang](https://chaohuang2018.github.io/). 

* From April 2022 to September 2023, I experienced a period of memorable working time in the P2 team of [Parametrix.AI](https://chaocanshu.cn/index-en.html).

* Prior to the industrial experience, I earned my MEng in Computer Science at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Xiaoyang Tan](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/xtan/).

* Before that, I also received my BS in Mathmatics at the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics in 2019.
